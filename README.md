# Player-performance-Analysis
In modern football, data analytics has become an essential tool for player evaluation, scouting, and transfer decisions. With access to extensive datasets like the FIFA 23 Complete Player Dataset, clubs can make evidence-based decisions about which players offer the best value for their performance.

This project aims to analyze player attributes, market values, and performance metrics to answer key questions such as:

Which players are the most valuable and why?

How does age affect performance?

Which nationalities dominate FIFA rankings?

What player attributes (e.g., pace, shooting, passing) most influence market value?

The analysis involves data cleaning, exploratory visualization, and predictive modeling using regression techniques to forecast player value based on performance attributes.
